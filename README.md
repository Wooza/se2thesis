# se2thesis -- A Thesis Class for the Chair of Software Engineering II at the University of Passau, Germany

The `se2thesis` bundle provides a document class for writing a theses with the
[Chair of Software Engineering II](https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/en/chair-for-software-engineering-ii/)
at the [University of Passau](https://www.uni-passau.de), Germany.
The class is based on Markus Kohm's
[KOMA-Script](https://ctan.org/pkg/koma-script) classes and provides several
additions and customisations to these classes.
While the class provides some basic settings, mostly regrading the type area,
fonts, and the title page, it still provides large degrees of freedom to its
users.
However, the package's documentation also provides recommendations regarding
several aspects, for example, recommending
[biblatex](https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) for bibliographies.
